EasyDraft
=========

An Easy to Use Offline Draft Application for Fantasy Football

EasyDraft is an application built on the flask python web framework using MySQL as the database backend.
EasyDraft was created for the ECE464 Databases class at the Cooper Union taught by
Professor Carl Sable in the Fall 2012 term.

This application is no longer available on the web as I am in the process of 
overhaling it for the upcoming football season.

## Hopeful New Features ##

* Redo draft backend, pull directy from Yahoo (Real Time Player Updates)
* More complete player statistics
* Automated draft sync with Yahoo Sports
* Save draft state, come back to it anytime
